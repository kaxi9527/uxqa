# UXQA model module

Protocol adapters, subscription authorization flows and required supporting
packages were migrated from Magpie (MIT), source revision
`51bdc985bc413c9e87a976ba08bcfa1054a0b699` (v0.1.3050).
The original copyright and permission notice is in LICENSE. Original file hashes
are in UPSTREAM-MANIFEST.json. Module import paths retain the original namespace
for source compatibility; this is not the Magpie application or its executable.

UXQA additions: `cmd/uxqa-core`, `internal/appdir/uxqa.go`,
`internal/provider/uxqa.go` and their tests. Adaptations confine configuration,
cache and credentials to UXQA; disable external account discovery and switching;
prevent automatic CLI installation; use saved accounts as the native pool; and
brand authorization completion pages as UXQA. The host UI and private API belong
to UXQA. The original main, CLI, GUI and management web application are not bundled.

Public-release adaptation: Google OAuth client ID/secret defaults are removed from
`internal/provider/google.go`. Explicit UXQA process configuration is required;
missing configuration is surfaced by the private API and account UI before login.

Claude subscriptions retain the upstream reliance on an already-installed
official Claude Code runtime. Real account authorization and vendor entitlement
are required; local fixture tests are not evidence of a working paid subscription.
